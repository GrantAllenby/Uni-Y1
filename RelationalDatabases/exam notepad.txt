from consultant join contract on contract_lead = consultant_id
where consultant_status = 'ACTIVE'
or consultant_status = 'active'

from contract join employer on contract_client = emp_id
join job_expenses on expense_job = contract_id

where expense_approved < sysdate;



SELECT consultant_id     AS "ID", 
       consultant_fname  AS "First Name",

       charge_fee        AS "Fee", 
       charge_expenses   AS "Expenses" 
FROM   consultant 
       JOIN contract 
         ON contract_lead = consultant_id 
       JOIN charge_sheet 
         ON charge_job = contract_id 
       JOIN job
