    <h3>Edo Period</h3>

    <p class="thistory">Tokyo was originally a fishing village called <strong>Edo</strong>. It was first fortified by
        the Edo Clan in the <strong>12th century.</strong>
        <br>This was also where the centre of the government was stationed during this period.

    <h3>1869 - 1943</h3>

    <p class="thistory">After the reign of the Shogun had ended, Emperor Meiji moved from Kyoto to Edo. The city was
        renamed to Tokyo which means “Eastern Capital” and it became the official capital of Japan.
        <br>Before that it already was the center of politics and culture.<a class="treference"
